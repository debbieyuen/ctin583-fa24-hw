Then copy over the main branch only before hitting **Create Fork**.

Clone **your** new repository via Terminal or GitHub Desktop. Instead of my repository, remember to clone the new repository you created. 
Remember to add Debbie (@debbieyuen) and Jerry (jerryxu1999) to your repository under settings!!
If you are cloning with Terminal, use `cd [folder name]` to clone it to the location of your choice.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/debbieyuen/ctin583-fa24-hw
```
If this is not hw02, remember to fetch for the new assignments before starting each homework assignment!
```bash
$ git checkout origin main
$ git status
$ git pull origin main
$ git fetch upstream
```
Create a new branch with your name. For me, I will name mine `debbie`. 
In Terminal, you may create a branch with the following commands: 
```bash
$ git checkout -b debbie
```

Now you can get started programming! The problems will be labeled as `TODO:`

When you have completed your homework assignment, please push the code to your repository! 
If you are using Terminal the commands are:
```bash
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "submit homework assignment"
$ git push origin debbie
```
Last but not least, navigate to your repository on GitHub.com and create a new pull request. And assign Debbie (@debbieyuen) and Jerry (jerryxu1999) as **Reviewers**.
